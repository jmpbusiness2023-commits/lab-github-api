# lab-github-api

GitHub Profile Analyzer — a tool that connects to the GitHub API to fetch and display useful information about a user's public GitHub account.
You’ll start by allowing a user to enter a GitHub username, then retrieve and show key details such as their profile info, list of public repositories, most-used programming languages, and popular projects.
